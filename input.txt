in the case of forest management, weneed to regenerate the stand.And, when we say regeneration, we also fell some trees that are there on the stand tomake way for the new growth of the young plants.Now, when you have decided following any Silvicultural management prescription that certain numberof trees are to be removed from the forest or from a stand how do you remove them?What is the procedure?What are the things that you need to be careful about when you are removing these plants iswhat we are going to see in this lecture.Now, the process of logging begins with a stage that is known as cruising.Now, cruising is a stage in which the forester surveys the timberlands.So, this is essentially a process of surveying to locate and estimate the volumes and gradesof standing timber meeting the requirements.Now what does that mean?We have seen in one of the earlier lectures that when you are when you want to removecertain trees, the first thing the first trees that we remove are the dead, dying and diseasedtrees.But then the question is, where are those trees?Because, if we consider a forest; so, if this is a forest, then all the dead, dying, diseasedtrees will not be at the same location.Probably, this tree is a diseased tree.But then, if we look at a complete stand probably, you will have a diseased tree here, a fewhere, a few here, probably a few here, then a few dead trees in this location, a few hereand there, and a few dying trees that are spread here.Now the question is, this is a stand in which you are having these dead, dying and diseasedtrees.Now, your forester needs to know where exactly each of these trees are located, so that hewhen these trees have to be removed, the forester can go to that location or a contractor cango to that location and fell these trees.So, the first stage is surveying.So, you survey for the different kinds of trees.Next, you also do a surveying of which are the trees that are silviculturally availableto be removed, which means that we should be having certain trees that are past thetheir felling age.So, they are large sized trees; they have sufficient diameter; they have sufficientgirth; and so now, these trees have to be felled.Now when you want to do felling, then invariably, you will want to remove these trees or thesetimber.Now when you have to remove this timber, you need to make a plan.So, the plan would be, for instance, where should you make the roads for your vehiclesto get inside?How many vehicles do you need?How many workers do you need?And, how are you going to arrange for these logistics?Because, in the case of any forest, we prefer not to perform any of these felling operationsin the rainy season.Because, if there is a rainy season, then probably the roads will not be in a serviceablecondition, and the vehicles when they are when you are trying to get the vehicles intothe forest, they might get stuck, because of which the whole the whole operation wouldstall.Now, if you want to remove this timber before the onset of the monsoons, then you need tomake a very detailed preparation about on what day, which vehicle and how many laborerswould be at which location?So, for that, you need to have a map that is showing you the locations of differenttrees that have to be felled and also the volumes of those different trees that haveto be felled.Because suppose there is suppose you have vehicles that can only carry say 20 cubicmeters of timber; now, if there is a location that is having say 25 cubic meters of timber,then probably you will have to plan your routes in such a manner that your trucks are ableto move out with a full load.So, you need to create this map.So, the first process in logging is cruising, in which the foresters service the timberlandsto locate and estimate the volumes and grades of standing timber.Grades of standing timber meaning whether it is with it whether this is a class 1 ora grade 1 timber, grade 2 timber, grade 3 timber and so on.Why?Because, if you are having a location where you are having grade 1 timber and you arefelling that timber, then probably it is much more economical to harvest that timber evenat the cost of certain other timbers; probably having a larger volume, because this is amore expensive timber.So, the forester is surveying to estimate the volume and the grades of standing timberwhich meet your requirements.Now, once this cruising has been done, the forester will come out with a map.So, this is a map that has been created and this map is now telling you that apart fromthese trees that are dead, dying and diseased trees, there are these trees that are largein size that have to be felled.So, suppose, this is a map that the forester has come up with.Now, this map or this information needs to be translated back to the field because yourforester has done this or this paperwork he has identified, which trees have to be felled.But now he or she needs to go back to the forest and paint those trees in differentcolors, so that the contractor who will go later on to cut these trees, knows that theseare the trees that need to be felled.So, this is in the next process which is known as marking.Marking is the careful selection of trees for harvesting based on a forest managementprescription.So, this is a selection of trees.Now how do we do this selection?So, in the first stage, when the forester went into the forest, he or she made a listof what all species are there, in which locations, what is their height, what is their girth.And suppose, you have decided that you are going to fell all timber.So, you fell timber that is greater than say 90 centimeter girth at breast height.Now, when you are making a list of different trees, so suppose you have tree number 1,which is having say 70 centimeter girth; tree number 2 which is having say 95 centimetergirth; tree number 3 which is having 98 centimeters; tree number 4 which is having 100 centimeters;tree number 5 which is having 60 centimeters; tree number 6 which is having 97 centimeters,and say tree number 7 which is having 101 centimeter.Now suppose, your forest felling prescription has come out in such a manner that you haveto remove one-third of the trees.So out of every 3 trees, you are going to remove 1 tree.So, in this case, because you have these 7 trees, probably you will remove 7 by 3 whichis a approximately 2 trees.So, you are, in this case, you want to remove 2 trees.Now when you are removing 2 trees, which are having the girth of more than 90 centimeters,then you could say go for the first 2 trees; these 2.So, this one is having 95 centimeter; this one is having 98 centimeter.But then, when you are doing these operations, then probably it will make much more sense,if for instance in place of going with these 2 trees, you went with this tree and thistree because these are meeting all your prescriptions; but at the same time, these are the more largersize trees.So, in that case, you will be able to extract much more volume of timber.So, if that needs to be done, then this is a process of the selection of the trees.So, even though you were having so many different trees; so, tree 2 could be selected, 3 couldbe selected, 4 could be selected, 6 could be selected, 7 could be selected.So, you had all these different trees, but out of these 5 trees, you only selected these2 trees which were number 4 and number 7.Now, when you do this and when you translate this information to the ground, then thisis marking.So, this is careful selection of trees for harvesting based on a forest management prescription.So, in at all times, you are ensuring that the forest management prescriptions are beingfollowed.So, you are only removing one-third of the trees, but while following the managementprescriptions; you are also removing those trees that are much more profitable.Now, when this information has to be put back to the ground, we typically make use of coloredrings.So, these are the standard colors that are used.So, if there is a tree that has been colored with a yellow or orange colored strip; so,what is this color?What are we talking about?So, here you have a tree.So, when we say that this tree will be marked it means that we will remove certain amountof bark from this area and we will paint a strip all around this tree.So, this is a red colored marking and this red colored marking would tell us that thisis a boundary tree.If suppose, in place of a red colored marking, we went with a yellow colored marking, itwould give a signal to the contractor that this is a tree that has to be felled.So, these are the strips that we put around these trees by using paint and all of thesedifferent colors will give different meanings.So, a yellow or orange color marking will tell the contractor that this is a tree thathas to be cut or for harvesting or for tending operation.If it is a blue colored strip, it means that this is a tree that is not to be cut.This is a tree that needs to be retained and typically these are trees that are on thebanks of rivers.So, if this is a river, and these are the trees on the bank of the river, what willhappen if we do a felling in this area?Well, if we do a felling, then probably there will be much more amount of soil erosion;the banks will get eroded and the river will change its course.So, in that situation, what we do is that we paint these trees with a blue colored paintand this will tell the contractor that this is a tree that is not to be felled.Now, typically there are also certain other trees.So, suppose there was there is a tree that was say, planted by some emperor, or say some viceroy, and you need to you need to preserve this tree for say, cultural reasons or for historical reasons.In that cases, were you will paint this tree with a blue colored ring.So, a blue color will tell the contractor that this is a tree that needs to be retainedand not to be cut a red tree is a boundary line tree.What that means is, suppose this is your forest and this forest is divided into different compartments; so, the trees that are falling on these boundarieswill be given a red colored band.So that people know that this is a boundary.A white colored line will tell that this is a tree that belongs to a research plot.So, this is not for silvicultural purposes, this is just for research purposes.So, nothing needs to be done in this area.A black colored marking is a correction marking, it is to mark over mistakes.So, suppose there was a tree that had to be reserved; so, you have to paint it with bluecolor but for some reason in place of blue, you painted it with an orange color.So, an orange color would tell that this tree should be cut, but then you realize your mistake.So, what will you do?You will go back to that area and paint it and over; paint it with a black colored strip.So, a black color will tell you that will tell the contractor that there was a mistakethat was done and the other color is the correct color.Now, this marking is done with the use of a marking register.Now, this is an example of a marking register.The area is 260 hectares, and here you see that you have a tree number.So, all the trees in your stand are numbered and for each tree, you have the name of thespecies; you have the girth at breast height; you have the condition of the tree whetherit is uprooted, hollow, burant, broken, etcetera.Then, you have the estimated pool length that you will get when you cut this tree, estimatedvolume or length and any other remarks.So, for instance, this tree this padauk tree is having a buttruss.Now, a buttruss means that your tree is like this.So, this is your tree, but then it has roots that are coming out and they are supportingthe weight of this tree, but then, in this case, it will be difficult to fell this treeat say the breast height.So, these are the remarks that we also put into the marking register.Now once you have marked your trees the next operation is felling.Now felling is cutting trees using axe, saw, chainsaw or other device.So felling is the actual process in which you are cutting or harvesting the trees.Now, whenever we are doing felling, the foremost thing - the most important thing - is safetyon the forest floor, because a tree is a very tall organism; now so and, forestry happensto be one of the very accident-prone professions.So, if you have a tree, and you are felling it, then if you are not careful, this treemay fall over the person.And, if that happens, it may result in say an injury or even death.So, whenever you are whenever any forestry operation is being done, the foremost thingto be kept in mind is safety on the forest floor.Now, what kinds of safety operations we need to be aware of?One, if there is a stack of timber, people should not walk over this stack.Because timber is typically a cylindrical object and if you try to walk over it, thereis a good chance that it will roll and you topple down.I mean it’s just common sense, but you need to be aware of it.If there is any machine that is working, then for each and every different machine, thereis a minimum distance that you need to maintain so that there is no chance of injury.Then, when a tree is being felled, then also you need to maintain certain distance fromthe tree.Then, you need to use certain protective equipment such as helmets or such as goggles.So that when somebody is say, using a chainsaw, then there will be some amount of powder fromthe operation that comes out.Now, that powder might get into the eyes.So, if you are doing; if you are using a chainsaw, it is better to make use of goggles.Similarly, if there is a machine that is making a very large sound, then probably it is goodor it is much more prudent to go within earmuff.And, whenever you are doing anything, you should have a planning meeting in which caseyou should talk with your come with your colleagues about what is it that you are going to do,so that nobody is caught unaware.All of these are very common sense things, but they need to be ensured.And similarly, whenever any tree is being felled then the escape paths need to be decidedfrom the beginning.So, suppose you have a tree, so here you have a sloppy ground, and there is a tree thatis standing here, and you are trying to fell this tree.Now, if you are felling it in such a way that it falls in this direction, then you shouldnot be standing in this place.Because, in this case, that it may fall over you.But then, if you are trying to make your tree fall in this direction, there is also a chancethat it will fall in the opposite direction.So here again, you should not be right behind the felling direction because this is a moreaccident-prone area.So, typically, whenever we do a felling operation, if the felling direction is here, then thisis a no-go-area and right behind also is a no-go-area.And, these are 2 escape paths that we decide which are at 45 degrees to this line.Now whenever, the felling operation is done, typically it is done using three differentcuts.So here, you have a tree and you want this tree to fall in this direction.So how can you ensure that?So, we do this by first making a cut here, a cut here and then we remove this portionof the log.So, after this, this section would look like this.Now, in this case, you have created a hole or a notch to the right of the tree.So now, if and right after that, you start giving it a felling cut or a back cut fromthis side.So, you will use your axe or a chainsaw to start cutting the tree from this side.Now, because in this area, you have created this gap, this hinge; so, your tree will startfalling in this direction.And, when it starts falling, the fibers in this side, they get more and more stretched.When they get stretched and you use your chainsaw; so, one after the other the fibers are gettingcut and then your tree is now giving a more and more greater lean.And, slowly and steadily, it will topple to the right side.So typically, what we do is that, suppose this is the trunk; so, you will give it aface cut.So, this is the lean or the felling direction.So, in the lean or the felling direction, you will give it a face cut.Typically, this face cut is given to a depth of 1 by 3 of d, which means that this depthis one-third of d.If this is d, then this is one-third of d.So, this is the face cut.Then, you give a back cut from the backside.So, this cut will move in this direction and there will be certain amount of wood thatwill be left out.So, what we are saying here is that when you are doing this operation, this cut does notcompletely go to this point, because before it reaches this point your tree will havealready toppled down.And, this section which is known as the holding wood, this would act as a hinge and this willhold the tree together till it falls to the ground.So, these are the cuts that we make - the face cut and the base and the back cut.And, the face cut is comprised of the top cut, the bottom cut, and then you have theback cut.So, when you begin your felling operation, the first cut is this one.So, you make use of your chainsaw or your axe to give it a cut like this.So, this is the first cut; this is the second cut, and then you start giving at it a cutfrom the back, and then your tree will topple to this direction.Now when you are making these cuts, you create faces, which is why we call it the face cut.And typically, we use 3 different kinds of faces.The first one is a conventional face.Now in the conventional face, the first cut or the top cut is at 45 degrees to this lineor to the vertical.So, you have a 45 degrees cut which is the top cut, then the bottom cut is parallel tothe ground.In the case of a Humboldt cut, you or a Humboldt face, your top cut is parallel to the ground,the bottom cut is at 45 degrees, and in the case of an open cut, you make an angle whichis greater than 70 degrees.So, these are 3 typical faces that we make use of.And all these 3 different faces have different utilities.The conventional face gives the greatest accuracy in constructing the face cuts.Because in this case, this angle is very easy to construct because we are seeing it fromthe top.So, from the top this cut and this cut both of them are easy to make.In the case of a Humboldt face, there is a greatest saving of lumber because, in thiscase, you have lost in the case of conventional cut, you have lost to this much timber.What we are saying here is that, when you give it a conventional cut, then when thetree falls down then typically, you will get a section that is looking like this.Now, but in this section, because this portion is hollowed out or is having a smaller size;so typically, you will have to cut this log from this location and this portion is nowno longer available.So, there is a loss of timber that happens in the case of a conventional cut.But, in the case of a Humboldt cut, because that your top cut is parallel to the ground,so in this case, there is a seaming of timber.Now, in the case of an open face, there is the greatest amount of control that is providedby the hinge wood because you can make these cuts very easily, and at the same time.you can have different angles for different tree species because of which you will havemuch more control over the way in which your tree is falling.So, in this picture, we are seeing a front cut that is being made.So, the these people are trying to topple this tree or cut this tree; so, that it fallsin this direction.Because of which they have given it a face cut in or a front cut like thisThen, you have the back cut that is being made here.So, in the case of this tree, the front cut is on this side, and now these people aretrying to make the back cut.And when they are doing this back cut, they are making use of saw, and in this case, 2people sit at the base of this tree and then they saw this tree to give it a back cut.Now whenever this these cuts are made, then the holding wood would form a hinge and thishinge wood typically be seen also in the stump.So, in this case, when this tree was felled then the then this was the holding wood, andthe fibers have gotten stretched and this holding wood was serving as a hinge till thetree fell to the ground.And, this is where we are seeing certain felled logs that are there right next to the doorto the road.Now, in more advanced countries, we typically make use of automated machines, and this machineis a combined logger machine.So what it does is that here, you can see that it has an arm and this arm will typicallygrab a tree near its base, then it will cut it at the base, then it will turn it, andthen there are rollers that are moving, this log like this and then it is cutting it atspecified distances.So, let us have a look at this video once again.So here what we are seeing is that, this is the automated machine, it has cut a tree.And then, the log has now come down and it is now.See, this is the log, and then this is the tree.And, it is now rolling this tree and it is cutting it into different smaller size sections.Now, once you tree has come down on the ground, the next process is that of delimbing.So, delimbing is cutting off of the branches and these branches are typically left on thesite.Now, why are they left on the site?For 2 or 3 reasons.One; it is not very economical or not very financially lucrative to cut the to carrythese small branches which typically have lesser diameters out of the forest.Because there are transportation costs involved, there is certain logistic cost involved, andbecause they do not fetch a large value so it does not make much sense to carry themaway from the forest.Second; when you leave these branches out there on the forest, typically these branchesalso have a number of leaves.And, these branches and these leaves form a layer on the ground which then protectsthe young crop against grazing.So, this is another benefit.The third benefit is that these leaves will form a mulching layer on the forest floorand will typically moderate the conditions which will help the next generation.So, this is the process of delimbing where you are cutting off the branches and typicallyleaving them on the site.The next process is that of bucking.A bucking is cutting off timber into logs.So, for instance, here you have a very large sized tree and it is difficult to carry thistree in two-two and in this case the foresters are cutting these tree this tree into smallersections.So, like this section, it is easier to carry it into the to the market.Now, when the when this felling is done, in India, we also make use of hammer marks.Now, if we look at this face here, we are seeing that there is a triangular mark andit is having certain numbers.So, this is telling us whether this tree is legally cut or whether it was illegally cut.So typically, the foresters are issued different hammers for different purposes.These hammers are taken on record and whenever there is a felling operation, all the treesthat have been felled in that area will be marked with this hammer, so that wheneveryou have any log that is seized from somewhere, and if you have a hammer mark, you can alwaystrace it back to men and where this particular log was felled.Next operation is that of skidding.Now, skidding is the process of movement of logs from the forest to a landing area.Now, landing area is an area where your vehicles can get inside and you can put the logs ontothe vehicle for transportation.Now why is a landing area important?Because if you go inside a forest there will be so, many different trees that it will bedifficult to bring a large-sized truck or other vehicle into the forest area.So typically, that the trees that are cut in the forest are brought to a location thatis closer to the road and this is known as the landing area.And, from the landing area, it will be picked up by a truck.Now, the process of taking your timber from the forest to the landing area is known asskidding.Now, from the landing area you can make use of a truck very easily because you have accessto the road.But from the forest, and typically if you have a forest in a hilly area and supposethis is your road, and this is the landing site, so how do you carry a lumber from thisplace to this place?That is the question.So typically, this is done using say elephants.So, here is this picture from the Andamans, and here we have this elephant; here you havea log that has been felled.So, notches are made at the end, then we tie an iron chain; and this chain is then attachedto the elephant, and the elephant carries these logs to the landing site from wherewe will make use of a truck.In certain areas, we do skidding using tractors.Now here again, the this lumber is not on the tractor; the lumber is tied with a ropeand this rope is tied to the tractor.So, it is essentially skidding it over the groundIn certain areas, we also make use of manual labour, and using all of these, we bring thetimber to the landing site.So here you have the logs that are there on the landing site.In certain cases, we differentiate these logs based on the diameters, and in which case,we make clumps so that we have a vehicle full of load for each of these stacks.So, we will have these sorts of stacking.So, everywhere like, this images from Finland, this image is from Harda, and in both thesecases, the process is one and the same.Now, here we are seeing a marking of this stack.Now, this stack in Madhya Pradesh is known as a thappi.So, this record is now telling you that this is a thappi number 56, the Sars stands forSagwan or Teak.So, here you have Sagwan, Latta, Balli and Dingre.Latta is a log that has a very large size a large diameter, Balli is a log with a smallerdiameter, and Dingre is typically the smaller branches that you can either leave on theforest floor, or in the case of our Indian forest, the villages might also take themfor use in say, for uses say firewood.So, this record is telling us that in this thappi number 56, we have 113 latta whichis large-sized logs, we did not get any Balli in this stack and there are 201 Dingre whichis the smaller branches.Next, we do the loading and transportation.So, loading and transportation is movement of logs from the landing area to the depot.And, this loading can be done using a crane.So, in here we are seeing that this is a landing site and here we have the road, here you areusing a crane to carry to move these logs onto a truck.It can also be done using a forwarder.Now a forwarder is a machine in which you have a truck combined with a crane.So, in this case, this is a landing site and this forwarder is taking these logs and puttingthem in on itself now.This is how a forwarder works.Now, in this case, this forwarder is taking the logs and depositing them on the depot.So, here it is taking it out and it is dumping them on this stack.So here you have a crane; here you have a stack of logs that are there in the truck,and with this machine we are taking these logs.And then, using the crane we are taking them out and dumping them.So, this is how a forwarder works.Now, when we have taken these logs to the depot, typically we get a huge quantity oflogs.So, this is a timber depot in Harda the district of Madhya Pradesh, and here you can see thatyou have so many logs that are there in this depot.Now what do we do next?Now, the first process that is required is that of seasoning.Now, what is seasoning?Consider a green tree.So, when this tree is felled, it will be having huge quantities of water inside it.Even our bodies are roughly 70 percent water.Similarly, with plants they are roughly 40 to 50 percent of their weight is made outof water.Now, if you have a log that is having a very large quantity of water and then once thistree has been felled, and this log is kept out.If this log is exposed to say the sun, then what will happen is that there will be a veryrapid loss of water from this log.And when that happens then typically, we will start seeing certain deformities in the timber.So, for instance, your timber may get cracks; it may get split, or in place of a flat timber;it may start showing bends or warps or kinks and so on.Now to reduce this possibility, we make use of the process of seasoning.Now, seasoning is the process in which we reduce the amount of moisture that is therein the timber in a controlled manner.So, in lower temperatures and in such a phased controlled manner that there is not that wedo not have a rapid loss of moisture which would result in certain deformities in thistimber.Now here what we are saying is that, these logs are kept in the shade of this tree sothat they are not exposed to the sunlight.And so, under this tree, the logs will slowly get seasoned; they will slowly and slowlythe moisture will get out and these will become seasoned logs.Now, another thing that happens in the depot is grading.Now, in the case of grading, you classify these logs so that the logs of similar diameter,similar girth and similar soundness are grouped together.When we say similar soundness, it means that those logs that are not having any holes,that are not having any splits, that are not having any warps, they are the best qualityof timber.So, all those logs will be grouped together.Now, within that group, those logs that are having the largest diameter and the largestlength will be grouped together and so on.So typically, a grading operation is also done in a depot which will result in the formationof these graded lots.So, here you have all this timber; they are looking similar.All of these are looking similar.So, for instance, these ones are having larger diameters, these ones are having smaller diameters.So, this is the process of grading.Now, once the grading is done, the next process is graded lots.So, what this person is doing here is that he is taking the measurements of each andevery log, writing them on the face of the log, noting them down in the depot register.And at the same time, he is making lots.Now typically, we make lots in such a manner that one lot will fit in one truck.So, it is one truck full of load that we make in the form of a lot, and then these gradedlots are then put up for auctioning.So, this is the whole process of logging till disposal of the wood.Now, once you have disposed off your wood, what happens next?So, there is a merchant that who has procured your woods, who has purchased your wood.Now, what does he going to do with that?Merchants can make furniture out of the wood, he can make door or window frames, he canmake doors or windows or he can use it to make certain other artificial products suchas plywoods or particle boards.Now what is plywood?Now, these days, to reduce the consumption of wood, plywood is advertised as a good option.Now the best thing about plywood is that it comes in the form of a flat sheet.So, it is very easy to work with.So how do we make plywood?A plywood is made by converting your log into very thin sheets.The process is very similar to sharpening of a pencil.So, you take a pencil and you put it through a sharpener, and what we get here is theseflat sheets of the wood.Now plywood is the process of making plywood begins with this stage.So, there is a sharpener, there is a wood or a log that is put with the sharpener andit is converted into very thin sheets.Now typically, how this works is that you have a log and this log is rotated on a machineand you have a blade which touches the surface of this log and this log comes out in theform of sheets.So, here we are seeing this process.So, there is a machine and this person is collecting the sheets that are coming outof the machine.This is how the sheets look like So in so using a single log now we are able to getvery large number of very thin sheets.Now these sheets are then kept together in the inventory, and to convert these sheetsinto plywood, workers apply glue to this to these sheets.So here you have a machine which has 2 rollers and there is glue that is which is movingacross these rollers.So, there will be a person on the back side who will be; who will be putting these sheetsone after the other, through these rollers and on both the faces of these rollers, theglue will get applied.And, this next worker is now collecting these sheets which have glue on both the sidesNow these sheets with the glue they are now arranged on a table in such a manner thatwe alternate the arrangement.So typically, if you have the sheets that are like thisin the first layer, then in the second layer the sheets will be kept like this.So, the direction of the fibers is interchanged with each layer, so that it is having so thatit so that, the final product gets a more uniform property and it’s having a sufficientstrength in all the directions.So, this is what this person is doing.So, you have one sheet that is below then the next layer of sheet is being put on thetop.Then, all these sheets are put into a hydraulic press, which then presses these sheets together.Typically, the ends of these presses are also heated up.So, this press will now apply great amount of pressure to these sheets and this willultimately get converted into a plywood.Now, when these sheets have been glued together, the pressure has been applied, all that remainsis to cut these conjoined sheets into standardized shapes which are known as plywood.So, in this lecture, we began by looking at the logging operation.So, the first stage in the case of logging operation is cruising.In the case of cruising, a forester will move through the forest, will note down, will markeach and will enumerate each and every tree and note down what is the species?What is the girth?What is the height?What is the soundness of each and every tree?What is the amount of branching that is there in different trees?So, for instance, if you have 2 trees, the first one is having a straight bole and thesecond one is having a branchy formation.Now, if both of these trees were silviculturally available, we would prefer this tree and notin this tree, because it is easier to work with this straight bole.So, all these different kinds of information where is each and every tree located, whatis the species?What are the dimensions?What is the soundness?What is the branchesness?Does it have a buttress or not?All of these are noted down, they are enumerated.Once that is done, the next process is that of marking.So, in the process of marking, we choose between these different trees to ascertain what whichare the trees that will be felled.So, once you have noted down these trees, you say you say that we are going to cut downthis tree, and we are not going to cut down this tree.Now, this process will be known as marking of trees.Now this is done not only on pen and paper, but is also reflected on the ground.How is it reflected on the ground?By the use of marking paint.So, this tree will be given a yellow colored paint on its trunk whereas, this tree willeither not be given any color or will probably be given a blue color.Blue color will say that this tree is not to be felled; the orange or yellow color willsay that this tree is to be felled; that we also have different other standard colors.Red color is for a boundary line, white color is for a research plot, black color is foroverwriting.So, the forester will after enumeration, he has marked these trees and he has gone tothe field and he has painted these trees with different colored strips.Now once that happens, then typically it is now given up to a contractor, or in the caseof Madhya Pradesh, we give it to a production division.Now, the people in the production division will now go to the forest and will start cuttingthese trees.Now how is a tree cut?The first stage is to ensure that you have sufficient amount of protection in that area.So, the people are given training, they are given typically the protective equipments,you make a plan about the leaning of different trees.So, for instance, suppose there is a tree that is leaning like this.So, it is better to make it fall in this direction than in the other direction.If you wanted to make a tree fall to the other side, that is also possible.So, you have this tree that is leaning to this direction.But then typically, but then probably you are having an electrical line in this side.So, you do not want this tree to fall to this side.This is to be avoided.So, what you will do is, you will attach ropes to this tree and you will start pulling itin the other direction, and then you will make your cuts so that it does not fall inits leaning direction.But typically, we prefer a tree to fall to its leaning direction.Now, certain modifications have to be made to the leaning to the direction of fellingso that your tree does not fall on another tree.Because, if that happens, then both these trees will get damaged.Then, we also ensure that it does not fall on any other establishment; it does not fallon any other infrastructure, such as road or say a powerline or say a water line andso on.Now, once we have decided of what is the direction what is the direction in which you are goingto fell your tree, the next thing is to plan an escape route.Now, escape route is if you have this tree and is it is going to be felled in this direction;so, there are these 2 escape routes and so, the person who is cutting or filling thistree, if anything if any mishap happens, he or she should use these escape routes whichare typically at 45 degrees, and there is a very low chance that your tree will fallon this line.So once that has been done, and people have been made aware of, next, we start to fellthe tree.Now in the case of felling, we begin by creating a face.A face is created on a tree by giving it a top cut.So, if the tree has to be felled in this direction, you will give it a top cut like this thena bottom cut, and when you have created these cuts, and you have removed this wood thenit creates a face.So, this is how the face will look like.So, this is now a face in the tree.So, this face was built using a top cut, a bottom cut.Both of which together are known as the front cut, and this depth is typically d by 3 whered is the diameter at this spot.Then, you start giving it a back cut.So, you start cutting it.Typically, it is done at a slightly higher location.So, you will start cutting it from here and you will probably make use of a saw to makethe back cut.Typically, we avoid the use of axes.We basically use saws because you have to cut down the fibers one by one and these fibersare already in a stretched position.So, consider that you have a very large number of strings that are kept tight, and you areslowly and slowly you are cutting the strings one by one.So that this tree will now lose its rigid its rigidity and it will start falling.So, as soon as you start making these cuts, this a back face will get created and yourtree will start to topple to this side.And typically, by the time you have reached roughly half of this portion, this tree wouldhave already fallen down, and this would have fallen down through the construction of ahinge at this location.So, hinge is the amount of wood that has not been cut.So, it was neither a part of the front cut it was not the part of the back cut.But because your tree was falling apart, so this portion the fibers in this portion theyget stretched and it forms a hinge, which helps you which helps us to make this treefall in a more gentle manner, which will in turn help us to protect this timber from damage.So, these are the cuts that we make to the tree.Now, once your tree has come down to the ground, the next operation is that of delimbing.Now, delimbing is the process in which the branches of the tree are gotten removed off,are gotten rid off.So, the branches are removed, the leaves are typically left on the forest floor and oncethat is done, the next process is that of bucking.Now, in the case of bucking, in place of canning, the whole timber together you cut it intosmaller portions and these smaller portions are then skidded to the landing site.In the case of skidding, you are not lifting this timber and putting it into a truck, insteadwhat you are doing is that you are attaching it with say a vehicle or say an elephant orin certain cases, we even make use of helicopters or even make use of cable cars.So, in this case, the wood will be attached, it will be skidded.So, when this is skidded, it is you are trying to move it across or between different trees,so that it comes to the landing site.Now, landing site is that location where your vehicle can come and at the landing site,you pick up these logs and put them into a truck.Typically, we make use of cranes or forwarders to move, to lift these logs and put them ontothe truck from this truck it is it will now go to a depot.Now in all this process, it is very important to keep records.The typical records are the enumeration record which was done during the cruising face.Also, the marking record which was done during the marking face.Once your tree has been cut down, then it will be hammered and different pieces willget their own numbers which will then be noted down into the felling register, and when theselogs are being transported, they will be again records generated.Now, once these logs have reached into your depot, then they will be taken down from thetruck typically, again either using forwarders or by using cranes.Now, once they have reached into the depot, then again we will make certain records, wewill go for the seasoning process, in which case the amount of moisture in the timberis gradually reduced to avoid the to avoid any warping or any defects that could havecrept inside.Then, we make and then we grade these logs ah, so that all the logs which are of thesame quality, the same diameter and the same length are put together in the form of a lotand then these lots are typically auctioned off.And after auctioning, people can make use of these logs to create furniture or theycan go with more modern products such as plywood, plyboard, particle board and so on.So, this is the process of logging and processing of timber.
Growing Stock and Increment.Now, a major purpose of classical forestry is to have the maximum growth of timber, sothat we can extract the maximum quantity of timber from a particular stand.And, the computation of the volume of the stand, the changes in the volume of the standis what we are going to have a look at in this lecture.So, we begin with growing stock.Now, growing stock is defined as, “volume of all living trees more than X centimeterin diameter at the breast height.”So, you are adding up the volume of all the living trees.So, you do not count the dead trees and you are only counting those trees that are morethan X centimeter in diameter at the breast height.Now, more than X centimeter means that very small trees or the saplings will not be countedin this definition.Now, why is that so?For two or three reasons.One is that in the case of very thin plants, it is difficult to take an accurate measurementof their girth or their diameters and so it is better to leave them, and two is that,if you look at any stand, the density of the stand will go down.Because, let us consider, a forest in which we were having a very large number of plants;now, with time these plants would grow their diameters would increase and they will startcompeting with each other.So, after a while when their diameters have increased, then the level of competition becomesso large that this side is unable to fit these many plants and so what will happen is a numberof these young plants will die out.So, essentially the mortality of the young plants is very large and so we do not taketheir measurements because we are unsure whether we are going to retain them in the stand ornot.At the same time, we have seen in the case of a natural forest that, if you plot theND curve the number versus diameter, we get a curve like this.Now, what this means is that, in the case of plants with very less diameter; so, thisis X centimeter, the number of plants is very large.Now, these are those plants that are not putting an appreciable influence on the total volumeof the growing stock, but then their number is very large.So, these are very thin plants in a very large number and because they do not put an appreciableinfluence in the total growing stock.So, as an engineering approximation, we can leave out these plants.So, it is difficult to measure them; it is to measure their girths, it is difficult tomeasure each and every plant, because they are in such a large number, it is very possiblethat a number of these plants would die out very soon.And, also these plants are not putting an appreciable influence on the growing stockand so, we leave out these plants whenever we are computing or measuring the growingstock.So, coming back to the definition volume of all living trees more than X centimeter indiameter at the breast height or above buttress, if these are higher measured over bark.So, the measurements of the diameter are being done over bark, because just to measure thegrowing stock, we are not going to remove the bark and do the measurements.So, the diameters are taken over the bark from the ground or stump height.So, in different countries, the measurements are either done from the ground or they aredone from the stump height.Now, in this case, we are measuring it from the stump height we are not measuring it fromthe breast height.Now, what is stump height?If we consider a tree and let us say that this is the breast height, which is 1.37 meters.this stump height is the height at which we are going to cut in this tree when we areharvesting, this tree this typically is around 1 foot.Now, the stump height; we want to keep it as low as possible because, if you increasethe height of the stump, you are losing away that would that could have been used otherwise.But then, the stump height has to be a finite value you cannot cut at 0 height because asyou go down there are pebbles, there are rocks, there is undergrowth.And, there is a good chance that your equipment, while you are cutting this tree, might strikeone of these pebbles or rocks and it might get damaged.So, to avoid the damage and also for the sake of convenience, you cut the tree at a certainheight and this height is known as the stump height.And why is this the stump height?Because, once you have cut this tree, then you will have a stump that is left on theground.And, the height of the stump is this one foot where you cut this tree.So, this is at the stump height.Now and when we are measuring the growing stock, the measurements are taken from eitherthe ground or the stump height, depending on the country, to a top stem diameter ofY centimeter.So, what we are saying here is that we are not going to measure it - measure the heighttill the height of the tree, but we are going to measure it till the point where the diameterof the main trunk reaches a diameter of y.So, we are going to take measurement of height such that above this height, the diameterof the main stem is less than y centimeter.Now, why is that so?Because remember that we are doing this growing stock measurement, for the case of commercialextraction of timber from this stand, and those stems that are less than y centimeterin diameter they do not have appreciable commercial value.And so, we do not take those measurements.Excluding or including branches to a minimum diameter of Z centimeter.What is it saying?It is saying that, if you have a branch and if this diameter of this branch is; so, letus say that here it is Z centimeter.So, you are going to take this measurement as well.So, you will include the branches till of a diameter of Z centimeter.Any branches that are less than Z centimeter in diameter will be excluded.Now, why is that so?Because the branches also can be used as timber and they also have a merchantable value.So, volume of all living trees more than X centimeter in diameter at the breast height,so removing the smaller stems measured over bark from the ground or stump height to atop stem diameter of Y centimeter, excluding or including branches to a minimum diameterof Z centimeter.So, it excludes the smaller branches, twigs, foliage, flowers, seeds, stump and roots.So, whatever biomass remains is a part of the growing stock.So, you do these measurements for the first tree, and let us say that the volume of thefirst tree is 1, for the second trees V 2, for the third three tree is V 3 and so ontill the end tree and you sum these up and this is the growing stock.Under the definition is, “the sum total of all the trees by number or volume or biomass,growing within a particular area of interest.”So, it is a sum total of all the trees growing within a particular area of interest, thatis typically a forest stand, and this sum total is by in terms of number.So, you can say that the growing stock is having say 1500 trees, or you can do thiscomputation in terms of volume by saying that the growing stock is say 100 cubic metersin volume, or you can do it in terms of biomass, in which case, you will say that this growingstock is say 75 k tons of carbon.So, you can do the growing stock computations in any of these formats and here again theexplanation is volume of all living trees more than 10 centimeter in diameter at thebreast height or above the buttress measured, over bark from the ground or stump heightto a top stem diameter of 10 centimeters, excluding or including branches to a minimumdiameter of 5 centimeters.Now, this is specific to India.So, in our country, we take the value of this in the previous definition we had taken itas X centimeter, Y centimeter and Z centimeter.So, here we are having that X and Y are 10 centimeters, and Z is 5 centimeters.And we also define a commercial growing stock.So, a commercial growing stock is a subset of the growing stock which is comprised ofcommercially important trees.So, the part of the growing stock of species considered as actually or potentially commercialunder current market conditions.So, if the market conditions change, the commercial growing stock will change, measured abovea minimum say X centimeter diameter at breast height.It includes all potentially commercial or merchantable species for domestic or internationalmarkets.So, essentially, the growing stock is to say simply - it is the total volume or total biomassof a forest, typically by computed, by removing very small plants, very thin plants and thoseparts of the plant or the trees that are not of a commercial value.Now, if you want to manage a forest for timber, you would want to manage it in such a mannerthat this growing stock is large.So, you would want to make to manage a forest such that the growing stock is large and atthe same time it is putting up increment.So, if we say that the growing stock at time t and say t plus 1; so, we want to managethe forest in such a manner that it has a large growing stock and this large growingstock is increasing still.So, any increase is something that we will be able to harvest, if you want to do thisharvest in a sustainable manner.So, we would want to manage it in such a manner that GS is large and the delta GS per unittime let us say at time t this is also large.Now, what are the factors that determine this GS and delta GS?So, let us have a look at that.Now, factors affecting growth in natural forest.One – regeneration.If you are having a forest in which the regeneration is less; so, in that case, the young generationare not coming up properly.And, in that case, the growing stock will either be stagnant or it will decrease asthe whole trees start to die off.So, regeneration is very important in the maintenance of growing stock.Secondly, the spatial distribution of plants.Now, the if the spatial distribution is such that the plants are evenly distributed, andall of them are able to have enough access to the resources; so, in that case, they willbe able to put up a larger increment a larger growth and so, your growing stock will increaseat a faster rate and it will reach larger values.On the other hand, if you have a spatial distribution, such that your plants are a very close togetherand they are out competing each other, in that case, the growing stock increments willnot be large.Silvicultural treatment.If you are managing your forests properly, you will get a larger increment in growingstock.If you do not manage it properly, then probably your growing stock will not be optimum.Artificial thinning.So, if whenever we are doing thinning, the growing stock goes down; but then the artificialis thinning is done, so that the plants that remain are able to put up the maximum incrementthat they are capable of.The growing stock also depends on the site conditions and the climatic conditions, because,if you have a site that is fertile and is having adequate amounts of sunshine and moisture,then it will be able to support a larger number of trees.And, it will be able to support a larger and faster growth of these trees.Now, similarly, in the plantation forest, the growth is dependent upon the initial spacingand treatment.The silvicultural treatments that are applied artificial thinning and pruning site conditionsand the climatic conditions.So, here, we can see that the growth is dependent on a number of factors both in natural forestsas well as plantations.Now, if you consider any piece of land, and let us say that we have planted this landwith some particular species, and we are trying to do a computation of the growing stock versustime.Now, at time 0 when you are doing this planting probably the growing stock is 0, because yourplants are so thin that they do not come into the definition of growing stock.And, probably your plants remain thin till say 4 years.So, from 0 to 4 years your growing stock is 0 this is time, this is the growing stock.Now, what happens after that?After this point, the growing stock; now, your plants have come to a stage where theirvolumes will be calculated or computed in the growing stock computations.Now, these are the young plants and these young plants are growing up at a very fastrate but, probably, they have not reached to that stage where their growth rate is thehighest.So, in this case, the sort of curve that we will see is that the volume or the growingstock will increase and it will go on increasing at a faster and faster rate.So, now, this is probably a point where the plants have reached to such an extent thattheir canopy is now covering the whole of the land.So, now, they are able to extract the maximum amount of sunlight as a total as a whole.So, once this canopy closure has happened, then the growth rate will start to reduce,because, now, the plants even though they are growing, but they are suffering a dearthof the nutrients; they are suffering a dearth of sunlight.And, they are probably also competing against each other, because of it they will not everyplant will be able to get the maximum quantity of water or nutrients from the soil.So, after a while the competition is increasing and increasing and so, the rate of growthwill be slowing and slowing, till a point where will see that the growth rate is noweither 0 or very close to 0.So, now, you are having a forest, in which there are trees, but then the trees have reachedto such a stage they are mature trees.But they are in such large number, that now they are not able to access anymore nutrients,there is not any growing space left for them.And, because of that, now, this strand is not showing up any growth.Now, this kind of a curve is known as a sigmoidal curve or an S shaped curve.And, if we wanted to represent it mathematically, we can represent it as a logistic growth equation.Now, a logistic growth equation is written as dy by dt where, y is the growing stockat any time t.So, the change in growing stock is equal to r, which is an intrinsic growth rate multipliedby y which is the growing stock at time t into K minus y divided by K, where K is thecarrying capacity of the environment.And, this is how this curve will look like when we plot it.So, essentially the logistic growth equation is the equation of a sigmoidal curve, anda sigmoidal curve represents the changes in the growing stock of the stand.So, we can represent a growing stock by the logistic growth equation.Now, in this curve, we can discern three phases; the first phase is known as a lag phase.So, in the lag phase, the growing stock is increasing, but it is increasing at a slowpace.So, it is increasing very slowly.Next, we will have an exponential phase.So, this is an exponential phase also refer to as a log phase.And, after this log phase, next, we will reach a phase of stagnationbecause now the growth is increasing, but it is, but the rate of growth is now movingtowards 0.So, that the total amount of growing stock will become constant.So, we can define these three phases lag phase, log phase and stationary phase.Now, why do we need to understand this growth curve?It is important because we want to understand the rate at which the growing stock is increasing.And, that rate of increase is known as the increment.So, increment is defined as, “an increase in growth, diameter, basal area, height, volume,quality or value of individual trees or crops during a given period.”So, when we say that a tree is putting up increment, we mean to say that it is increasingin volume; or it is increasing in height; or it is increasing in diameter; or it isincreasing in some other quality or value with time.So, these changes are known as increments and we can measure increment in terms of asingle tree or in terms of a forest stand.Now, this increment is comprised of a number of variables.Now, different trees are putting up increment, but not all at the same rate and not all atthe same time.So, when we look at the increment of a stand, we have to consider different phenomena thatare happening.The first phenomenon that is happening is in growth or recruitment which we representas I.And, growth is defined as the volume of those trees that were not counted in the first measurementdue to their small diameter, but are now countable due to increase in diameter.So, what we are saying here is that, suppose in the first stage, we were having some largetrees and some small trees.Now, this is at time t is equal to t 0.Now, if you look at time t is equal to t1, in that time, this plant has reached to thisheight; this plant has become something like this; this plant has become something likethis; this tree has increased in size, but probably this tree does not show any changes.Now, between time t is equal to t0 and time t is equal to t1, there are some plants thathave now entered into the calculation.So, like this plant number 1, it was neither counted during time t is equal to t0, butand nor in time t is equal to t1.This plant was counted in both is that the time periods, this third plant it was notcounted in the first computation, but during the time of the second computation say after5 years, it has now reached to two that diameter that it is now countable.The 4th plant it was not counted in the 1st instance, but it is now counted in the 2ndinstance.The 5th plant was counted in the 1st instance and also in the 2nd instance.So, in this case, these two plants 3 and 4 which were not counted which were not countablein the first instance, but are now comfortable in the second instance.We will call their volumes - the addition of their volumes into the growing stock asthe in growth.So, in growth or recruitment is the volume of those trees that were not counted in thefirst measurement due to their small diameter, but are now countable due to the increasein diameter.Second component is harvest, volume of those trees that were harvested during the measurementperiod.Now, it is possible that during your time let us say yeah the next time is t is equalto t 2.Now, from time t is equal to t 1 to t is equal to t 2, you have harvested this tree.So, this tree at time t is equal to t 2 it is not being counted.So, it was counted earlier during time t is equal to t 1, but at time t is equal to t2, it does not counted, because it no longer exists in that side, because it has been harvested.So, this harvest should also be computed in the growing stock computations, volume ofthose trees that were harvested during the measurement period.Now, similarly we also have mortality represented by M, volume of those trees that died duringthe measurement period.Now, remember that, in the case of the growing stock, definition we only count in the livingtrees.So, those trees that die off are not counted.So, let us say at time t is equal to t 2 by this time this tree has died off probablybecause it was old or probably because it got infested with some diseases or probablyit got burnt during the forest fire.So, this tree which has died off it will be represented in terms of mortality M.So, now if we look at the components of increment, we can define three things.Net growth in the growing stock will be represented as V 2 minus V 1 where, V 2 is the growingstock at time t 2 which is the volume of all the living trees above a certain diameterat time t 2 minus V 1 which is the volume at time b at time t 1.So, this is the net growth in growing stock.If we want to compute the net growth in the initial volume, in that case, we will haveto add H and subtract I.Because we are talking about the initial volume, during initial volume this I was not there;I is a component that we are getting from the in growth.So, because in growth is a new addition to the growing stock, we were not counting itbefore.So, if we are only talking about the net growth in the initial volume, we will have to removeI and we also add H. We add H, because H is something that we have extracted.So, that particular tree was there on the site during time t 1 it put up some certaingrowth and we removed it.So, the inner, so this H will be counted in the net growth in the initial volume.And, we also define a cross growth in the initial volume which is net growth plus mortality.Because, in the case of mortality, we have not removed this tree it died on the spot,but if we look at a gross change in the initial volume we will have to add this.Now, this increment is typically measured in terms of periodic annual increment or currentannual increment or mean annual increment.Now, these are defined as the periodic annual increment is the increment over a period ofp years, at any stage in the tree’s history.So, what we are saying here is that let us plot.So, this is V versus t and we are asking the question, how much was the increment betweentime t is equal to t 1 and t is equal to t 2?The volume at this time t is equal to t 1 was V 1 and here it was V 2.So, we will say that the total increment that is delta V is equal to V 2 minus V 1.Now, this increment happened in a time of delta t which is t 2 minus t 1 and so, wewill say that the periodic annual increment for this period t 1 - t 2 is equal to deltaV divided by delta t, is equal to V 2 minus V 1 divided by t 2 minus t 1.So, this is the volume of the stand at time t 2 minus volume of the stand at time t 1divided by the number of years between t 2 and t 1.So, this is periodic annual increment we are measuring annual increment.So, we are dividing everything by the number of years in between.So, what was the average annual increment, in this period?Now, this PAI will be different depending on the t 1 and t 2, if you took these 2 yearsin the beginning versus in the middle versus at the end, we will find that the PAI is verylittle in the beginning, it is very little in the end, and it is more in the center.Now, if in the place of this period of t 2 minus t 1, if we say that t 2 minus t 1 isequal to 1 year.So, we are doing these computations in such a manner that t 2 minus t 1 is 1 year, thenwe will say that the PAI is the current annual increment.So, current annual increment is “the increment over a period of one year at any stage inthe tree’s history.”What is the change in the volume per year?So, in this case, you will have CAI is equal to delta V by delta t and delta t is equalto 1.So, this is equal to delta V or if you want to represent it mathematically the CAI isrepresented as the slope of the curve at any point.So, the CAI is the slope of the curve.Now, if we represented the growing stock curve as V as y.So, we said that the growing stock is y, which is a function of t, then CAI is equal to yprime t or the differential of the growing stock curve with respect to time.The third thing that we; so, this is how it will look like.So, this is our curve y which is the sigmoidal curve represented here in blue.Now, if we look at the CAI or the differential of this curve, so the CAI at this point isvery less because the slope of the curve is very less, then the CAI will go on increasingand it will reach a maximum somewhere here at the inflection point.So, inflection point is the point at which the shape of the curve is changing; the directionis changing.So, on this side, it is concave; on this side, it is becoming convex, if you look at it fromthe top.So, this point will be called as the inflection point.So, the CAI will go on increasing till the inflection point, and then it will start toreduce and become 0 after a while, and this is what we are seeing in this y primed curve.So, y prime is increasing; it reaches a maximum at the inflection point, then it is startsto reduce, and then, after a while it comes close to 0.So, this is CAI or the Current Annual Increment.We also define MAI or the Mean Annual Increment.Now, the mean annual increment is asking the question, what is the average growth of thestand at any stage of its life?So, suppose the volume of the stand is V10 at the end of 10 years.So, every year on average this tree was putting up V10 divided by 10 cubic meters of growth.If you consider a volume say V20, so in 20 years it reached a volume of V20, if you wantto find out the mean annual increment it will be V 20 divided by 20.So, essentially MAI is for any time t is equal to y of t that is that the growing stock attime t divided by t, which is the number of years that it has taken to reach that valueof the growing stock.So, the mean annual increment is the mean annual increment over the whole period fromorigin to a specific age, and here, we are representing it with the yellow curve.So, the yellow curve is telling us that at this point we have a particular value of meanannual increment.Now, the mean annual increment is increasing with time, then it reaches a maximum and thenit starts to decrease.Now, why is that so?So, let us see let us consider the CAI, at this point this CAI is very large the MAIis less.Now, the CAI is increasing.So, CAI is telling you the change in the volume every year.So, when CAI is increasing it tells us that the total growing stock is increasing at afaster rate.So, the total growing stock is increasing increasing, then it reaches a maximum rateof growth at the inflection point, and after that the CAI is reducing, which means thatthe rate of growth is reducing, and after a while the rate of growth even comes to 0.But consider this point where both these curves are cutting each other.Now, after this point the current annual increment is less than the annual increment till thetill this age.So, what we are seeing here is that after this age of say around 27 years, the rateof increase every year is less than what was the average till 27 years.So, with every passing year, you are adding less to the growing stock as compared to whatyou were adding up earlier, but the denominator which is the number of years is going on increasing.So, what we will see is that the MAI will reach to a maximum, and after this point,it will start to decrease.So, the points where the CAI and the MAI curve cut each other is the point where you arehaving the maximum MAI.So, the crucial thing to remember is CAI is maximum at the inflection point where therate of growth is maximum, and MAI is maximum where the CAI and MAI curves cut each other.And, this cutting is important because it tells us the optimum harvest time.So, the optimum harvest time is the time when the stand has reached the maximum MAI or thepoint where the CAI and MAI cut each other.Now why is that so?Because after this point, the stand will be putting up more growth, but at a slower pace;the rate has reduced.Now, remember we needed two things in the stand.We want to have a stand with a very large value of growing stock and also a large valueof increment.Now, before this time, before the maximum value of MAI, the growing stock was increasingand the increment was also pretty substantial and so, we said that we should not be cuttingthe stand or harvesting the stand before this point.But after this point, even though the growing stock is substantial, but now the rate ofincrease is decreasing and so it will be much more profitable to harvest this stand, andprobably regenerate the forest.So, the points where; the point where the MAI and the CAI cut each other is a good indicationof what should be the rotation age for this particular species at this particular site.Now, the increment is not the same for every species; it is not the same for every site;it depends on the species; there are certain species that we call as fast-growing species.So, species like eucalyptus or species like poplar, these are the species that grow veryfast.On the other hand, we have certain species like teak which have a medium rate of growth,and there are certain other species such as sterculia that grow at a very slow rate.So, the increment that is being put up by a stand, will depend on the species, or thespecies composition of the stand.If it has those species that grow very fast, then we will be having a larger increment.If it has those species that grow slowly, then we will have a smaller increment.Increment also depends on the internal conditions that is genetic and physiological conditions.So, essentially, if you have those plants whose parents were showing very fast growth;so, their genetic constitution as such that they are showing up a faster growth.So, there is a genetic composition involved also there is a physiological compositionthat is involved.So, it will depend on the age of the plants.If the plants are young, or in amateurs, or in a growing phase, then they will show upa faster increment.If the plants are old, then their physiological state determines that the rate of incrementwill be lesser.Increment also depends on the external conditions climatic, edaphic and biotic conditions.So, why climatic?Suppose, it is a draught year; the plants are not getting sufficient amount of water;they are suffering from stress.So, the rate of growth will be lesser.The edaphic factors.If you have a site which does not have sufficient amount of nutrients, the rate of growth willbe less.Biotic factors; Suppose, you have a stand which is now infested with the disease.So, also the plants are now diseased and so, they are not able to put up a large amountof growth.So, it dip; so, the increment depends on species, depends on internal factors, it also dependson external factors.It also, at times, depends on those factors that are out of our control.So, suppose you have a site which recently suffered from a forest fire, the plants aregone.So, now, the increment will be 0, because you do not have any trees on that piece ofland.So, it also depends on catastrophic events.Now, the thing that is within our control is the sight quality.Sight quality is defined as, “the relative productive capacity of a particular site.”What we are saying here is that suppose, we have two pieces of forest, two pieces of landand we are growing forests on these pieces.The first one has low water availability; it has low amount of nutrients; it has saysoil that is impermeable.On the other hand, the second site has adequate water; it is fertile.So, it has sufficient amount of nutrients and the soil is porous or and a well drainedsoil, so it is easily able to accommodate the roots.Now, which of these two sites do you think will be better to raise the crop?So, obviously, the site 2 will be a better site.But then, let us consider a 3rd site which is also having all these three things, itis also having adequate water; it is fertile; it is porous; and probably both these sitesare right next to each other.But then inside 2, you do not do any silvicultural operation, in the case of site 3, you aredoing a scientific management.Now, which of these sites will have the highest production?So, in that cas,e we will say that this site 3 which had a good intrinsic condition.It had good water fertility; good soil plus we also gave it good management interventions.So, this side will be showing the largest amount of growth.So, the growing stock in 3 will be greater than the growing stock in 2 which will begreater than the growing stock in 1 because site one is having the least intrinsic productivity.So, when we talk about a site productivity, it depends on the site quality and the managementinput.But, if we only talk about the site quality; if we do not do any management input, we arenot increasing the fertility of the soil.We are not going with any plantations; we are not doing scientific thinning.If you only consider the intrinsic quality, so that will determine the relative productivecapacity of the of any site; we are not talking about absolute productive capacity.The absolute productive capacity will also be dependent on the management input, butif we just talk about the intrinsic qualities, we will be talking about the site quality.Now, when we talk about management inputs these could be application of fertilizer,treatment of site - say by plowing, irrigation of the site, control over grazing, controlover soil compaction, manipulation of the growing stock.If we are doing all of these, we are changing the absolute production capability of theparticular site; but, if we do none of these, then we are only talking about the site quality.So, how do we measure the site quality?There are typically two ways of measuring the site quality; the first one is the CVPindex.So, CVP talks about the climate, the vegetation and the precipitation of the area.CVP is also written as the Patterson index, it is given by T v by T a where T v is themean maximum temperature during the year, T a is the range between the mean maximumand the mean minimum temperature.So, the greater their the ratio, the greater will be the CVP index multiplied by P whichis the mean annual precipitation and in millimeters multiplied by G by 12.So, G is the growing period in months.So, how much is the growing period?Do you have a growing period that is say only 2 months or do you have a growing period thatis say 10 months?So, more the growing period more the CVP index multiplied by E divided by 100 which is thelight factor what is the availability of light in the site?So, it is talking about what is the temperature.Higher the temperature, higher the CVP index.It talks about the precipitation of the site; more the amount of water, more is the CVPindex.It talks about the growing season; more is the growing season, more is the CVP index.It talks about the availability of light; so, more is the availability of light, moreis the CVP index.And, it also talks about the range of temperature.So, if the range of temperature is less, then the CVP index will be high.So, essentially, if a site is having temperatures such that in every month you are having roughlythe same temperature, then the CVP index will be high as against a site that is showinga very great amount of variation.Now, forest growth is possible, only when the CVP index is greater than 25.Now, when we talk about the site quality, we can make use of the climatic data of thesite by looking at the temperature data, the precipitation data, the growing season, andthe availability of light in that area, to determine what will be the site quality ofthe area.So, this is one easy way or one mathematical way of finding out the site quality.Another is through the use of vegetative characteristics.So, if you go to a forest area and if you see, that this forest area is full of Palashtrees.So, in that case, you can make a conclusion that because Palash is an indicator of a degradedforest.So, in that case, this forest is not having a good site quality, because if it had a goodsite quality, then probably it would have been able to support other species other thanPalash.So, where nothing grows, we generally see Palash growing.So, if you only see Palash it means that the site is not capable enough of supporting othervegetation.So, by looking at this species that are present in a forest, you can have an idea of the sitequality of that site or you can look at that the tree characteristics.So, you visit two forest areas and in one forest area you have very tall trees.So, you have trees that are very high, you have trees that have a very large amount ofgirth.So, this is the first site; site 1 then you go to site 2.And, in site 2, you have plants that are stunted.Even its an old growth forest, but the plants are stunted and they have lesser girths.So, in that cas,e you will get an idea that site 1, because every other thing being constantthe first site was able to support trees to a larger size, to a larger height, to a largervalue a girth or volume as compared to the second site.So, probably the site quality of the first site is better than that of the second site.So, you can make an estimate of the site quality by either looking at the CVP index of thesite, or by looking at the species that are present in the site, or by looking at thetree characteristics of that particular site.And, when we talk about tree characteristic there are two methods; the first one is acrop height method.So, in the case of the crop height method you get the top height and compare it withthe yield table.What is top height?Top height is defined as the main height of the trees with the largest deviation is stand.So, when we say top height, we are not saying that we are measuring the height of the tallesttrees, probably you have this tree which is at the tallest tree, but if you look at thetrees in this stand.So, if you look at those trees with the highest dbh or the largest dbh, and you find out theirheights and you do an averaging of the heights of those trees that belong to highest dbhclass.When we say class, we are saying; let us say 0 to 10 centimeters, 10 to 20, 20 to 30 andso on.So, those trees that belong to the largest diameter class; you measure the heights takean average, and that is the top height and when you do that you can compare the cropheight with the yield table.So, yield table is a compilation of the growth stat of the growth statistics of differentstands at different points of time.And so, in a yield table, it will give you an idea that in the case of the best sightquality is a sight quality I, the top height is say 30 meters.Sight quality and top height.For sight quality I the highest it goes is say, let us say 35 meters; sight quality II,you reach 30 meters; sight quality III, you reach say 28 meters; sight quality IV, youare only able to reach 25 meters.Now, you go to a site and you measure the top height, and you find that the top heightis 30 meters.So, then you can say that this site belongs to a sight quality II.So, this is one way of looking at the tree characteristics.So, we find out the top height, compare it with the yield table and we get the site quality.Another method is the sample plot method.So, in the sample plot method, you take a sample plot in your forest.So, in this large forest, you took a few sample plots.And, in these sample plots, you do a measurement of the diameter and the height of differenttrees, and then you plot the diameter and height curves for different for differentindividuals in the sample plots.And, then you compare it with the standards.So, in this case here, we are seeing that the height versus diameter curve of Sal treesin a forest stand.So, this was forest stand and so, here we see that this black one is the one that weare getting from the field data.So, we saw that we have trees of different diameters and these are the different heights.So, you plot this and you also plot the site qualities that the diameter and height dataof different site qualities that you get from the yield table.Now, if we look at this curve, we can very easily see that this black line is close tothe green one; green one is site quality III.So, in this case, we will say that the site quality of the of the forest stand in Timlee is site quality III.So, this is also another method of finding out the site quality.So, in this lecture, we had a look at the growing stock.Now, growing stock is defined as the total volume of all the trees in a stand and wewhen we say total volume it is volume only of the living trees, and not including thevolume of those trees that are less than a particular diameter at breast height.And, it also does not include very thin branches; it also does not include things such as theroot or the stump or the leaves or the fruits and so on.So, you can do it in terms of volume; you can do it in terms of weight, and so on.So, when we are; when we are managing a forest for timber, we would want to have a forestthat has the largest amount of growing stock, and also a forest that is showing a largeamount of increment.Now, increment is defined as the change in the growing stock per unit time.So, we can define periodic annual increment which is change in growing stock divided bythe number of years that have passed in between.Or, we can define the current annual increment which is equal to the differential of thecurve that represents the and the growth of the stand, which is typically a sigmoidalcurve showing a logistic growth equation.So, if you take the slope of the curve, it will give you the current annual increment.The third thing is the mean annual increment; mean annual increment is the is a growingstock at year n divided by n number of years.So, what is the average amount of increment that your stand has been putting up sincethe time it was grown?So, that is the MAI.Now, typically in the case of forest stand, the CAI increases reaches to a maximum atthe inflection point of the growth curve, and then it starts to reduce.The MAI also increases, and it also starts to reduce.Now, MAI is maximum, where the CAI and MAI curves cut each other.And, that is the point where the stand has reached an appreciable value of growing stock.And, it has also reached the maximum amount of rate of increment that it could achieve,because after this point the rate of increment is going to go down.So, this gives a very good indication of the rotation age for that particular species atthat particular site.Now, the rate of increment depends on a number of factors.It depends on the species; it depends on the site conditions, both intrinsic conditionsas well as extrinsic conditions.So, there we can make an estimate of the site quality which is defined as that as the relativeproductive capacity of a site.If you are not giving any management inputs to the site, what will what is the product,what is the relative productive capacity of this site as compared to a standard site.So, this comparison can be done in a number of ways.You can either go with CVP indexes, in which case, you look at the at the temperature data,the precipitation data, the growing period data as well as the availability of lightto compute the value of I for different sites.Or, you can do a field measurement by looking at the species that are growing in a site.So, if a site only has those species that grow in degraded areas and does not have anyspecies that grows in rich soils, then probably this that particular site is not having agood site quality.Or, you can make use of tree characteristics.Tree characteristics include measurement of the top height.So, in the case of top height, you take the average height of those trees that belongto the highest diameter classes.And, you compare that with the yield table and you get an idea of the site quality.Or, the second method is to take sample plots, and then plot the height versus diameter curveand compare it with the standards.So, by looking at the site quality, you can make an estimate of the rate of growth orthe rate of increment as well as the maximum amount of growing stock that your site willbe able to support.And, if you want to increase the site quality, probably you will have to go with some amountof amelioration in the site, or some amount of management inputs to the site.So, that the fertility goes up or what it is available for a longer period of time orprobably you could even construct a greenhouse.So, by doing all of these, you can ensure that the growing stock is very large and it is also growing at a very fast rate.
Yield and Sustained Yield: Now, the basic question when we are doingclassical silviculture is this. You have a piece of land and there are a number of treeson this piece of land. Now, you have got two options; option 1 is to clear fell this areaand extract all the timber. Now, if you go with this option, then yield - we will ask“what is the total amount of timber that will get extracted or harvested?” So, thisis the first way in which we can define yield. What is the total value of timber or whatis the total volume of timber that we can extract from this forest? But in a numberof situations, we do not want to go with this clear felling. So, we can look at option 2.Now in option 2; the owner of this forest might say that, “I do not want all thistimber right away, but then I have my own needs.”So, like every year, I require some timber for my own use, I require some timber thatI can sell to the market and get some money. Now, if I wanted to manage this forest insuch a manner that every year, I should be getting some amount, and this amount shouldbe steady it should be constant. So, in that case, how do I manage this forest? So, option2 is, you harvest not the complete forest but a portion of the forest every year, andthe objective would be in a sustained manner.Now, what do we mean by a sustained manner? If we were to draw a plot between the volumeextracted per year versus the year, or let us say time then sustained yield would saythat the same amount should be extracted every year. And, it will be of benefit to the forestowner, if this amount could be maximized. So, what we are saying here is that suppose,it is possible to extract say 10000 cubic meter every year, but we are extracting 8000cubic meters every year. Now, from this forest, it is possible to extract 8000 cubic metersper year, but if we extracted 2000 cubic meters more, even then it would have been a sustainedoperation. So, every year, we could have gone with 10000cubic meters. So, why not go with that? So, this second definition of yield says, whatis the sustained amount of timber or rather the maximum sustained amount oftimber that can be extracted or harvested every year.. So, these are the two meanings of yield. Thefirst meaning is the amount of timber that can be harvested per unit period; generally,this period is taken to be one year. So, the amount of timber that can be harvested everyyear or the amount of timber that can be removed at any time. So, at any time, it means thatwe are taking a snapshot and we are asking the question what is the total amount of timberthat I have.To understand this problem, suppose you have deposited 10000  into your bank accountand this bank is giving an interest at the rate of 10 percent per year. Now, let us plotthe amount that we have in the bank versus the year. Now, in the 0th year, you deposited 100000 . Now after 1 year, the amount plus the interest so, the interest that wewill have is 100000 into 10 by 100 is equal to 10000.So, at the end of 1 year, the amount that we have in this bank is now 100000 plus 10000,is 110000 . So, at the end of 1 year, you have 110000 . Now, similarly ifyou have a forest that suppose currently has a total growing the stock of say 100000 cubicmeters, and it is having an increment of 10 percent, and we will say that at the end ofone year we have a volume of 110000. So, it is one and the same thing.Now, out of this amount, suppose you were to extract 10000 . So, out of your 110000, you extracted 10000  from that account for your own use. So, now, the amountthat remains is minus 10000 is back to 100000. So, from here you have shifted back to thispoint. Now, at the end of the second year, again the bank is giving you the interest.Now because the principle is the same it is 100000 . So, now, the interest alsois the same; it is again 10000  and so, the amount again goes up to 110000.Now, in this year, you again extract 10000  and so, you are bringing the situationback to the starting position. So, as long as the rate of interest; or in the case offorest, the rate of increment does not change; and so long as the your principal is not lost,such as in the case of forest, if there is no forest fire; if there is no infestation.So, at the beginning of every year, the situation would be the same as what it was at the beginningof the previous year. At the end of every year, the situation will be the same as itwas at the end of the previous year. So, this is a sustained yield. Now what will happen?If suppose in place of extracting 10000  you extracted more.If so, let us look at the second scenario; so, we began with 100000  and at theend of the first year, the amount increased to 110000, but then in place of extracting 10000  suppose you extracted 20000 . So, what is the situation now?Now, in place of 110000, you will only be left with 90000 , because you have extracted 20000. Now, at the end of this year; at the end of the second year, what is the amountof interest that you will get? Now the interest that you will get is on 90000  only;you are not getting the interest on 100000 .So, the interest here will be 90000 into 10 by 100 is 9000. So, at the end of this year,you are getting a sum of 90000 plus 9000 is 99000. Now, suppose you extracted 20000 againfrom here. So, now you are getting down to 79000 and at the end of the third year this79000 will give you an amount of 79000 plus 7900 which is the interest so, this is theprinciple this is the interest is 86900. So, what we are observing here is that, yearafter year, the amount is going down. So, year after year the amount is going down;so, this is not a sustained yield. Now, when we look at the meaning of yield where we saywhat is the amount that can be extracted per unit time every year this is what we are talkingabout. What is the amount that you can you can takeout of your bank, such that at the end of the year, you will be at the same situationas it was at the beginning of the year. Now, the second meaning is what is the amount thatyou have in your bank. So, if we ask the question at this point of time, the amount that youhave in the bank is 100000 . So, if you were to clear cut the forest; ifyou were to extract all the amount that was there in your bank account, what would itbe? So, this scenario is saying that the amount will be 100000 . At this point of time,the amount is 110000 . At some other point in between, probably it is 105000 and so on. So, this is what this the second meaning ofyield talks about. If you were to clear cut the forest, what is the total amount of timberthat you will have? Now, this sort of a forestry when we talk about a sustained yield. It beganin Europe, because there were land owners who wanted to have a regular supply of incomethrough their forests. So, the question they were asking was whatis the maximum amount of timber that, I can extract or rather I should extract every yearto maximize my income, in such a manner that every year I should be getting this sourceof income. So, this is where this scientific forestry began.So, sustained yield is the yield that can be harvested every year till perpetuity; thisis what they were asking. How much amount can I extract every year in such a mannerthat this extraction can be done till infinity, till perpetuity.So, to answer this question a number of methods were developed to regulate the yield. Now,in the case of our bank example, it is easy to compute things because we know this rateof interest. But, in the case of a forest and especially in the case of a forest thatis an irregular forest or a selection forest, how do you get the rate of interest or therate of increment is the next question. Then again, not all the trees will be puttingup increment at the same rate because trees that are very young or trees that are veryold will probably not be putting up any significant increment, whereas, trees that are in themiddle age, which are mature trees, they will be putting up increment at a very fast pace.Now, when you are doing the extraction, you are typically removing the very old trees.But when you are removing the very old trees, then you are removing those trees that, butnot putting up a large increment and, you are making space for those trees that canput up much more increment. So, things tend to become a little more complicatedas compared to the bank example, because we do not know the rate of increment, we do notknow the interest rate, and finding out this interest rate is difficult. Now to solve thisproblem, these methods were developed. So, we have the area method, volume method, useof formulae, by number of trees, and these days we also make use of computer simulation.So, what do these methods talk about?Let us begin with the area method of yield regulation. Now, the area method says that,in the case of an even aged forest, the area that should be harvested every year is equalto the total area divided by the rotation period. So, in the case of an even aged forest,this method says,Let us suppose this is your forest and let us see the rotation age is 16 years. So, weare saying that R is 16 years, and the total area is equal to At, say for sake of simplicitythat this is 160 hectares. Area to be harvest will be given by the total area divided byR which is 160 hectares divided by 16 years is, 10 hectare every year, about this method.Now, suppose you have this forest and you do not know the age of different sections.Now this method, let us you convert this forest into an even aged forest, and ensure thatit will be maintained as an as an even aged forest. So, let us say that on 1st of Januaryyou clear cut this section. So, let us say on 1st of January 2020, you cleared up thissection. Now, you sold this timber in the market; you got some revenue, at the end ofthe first year, that is on 31st Jan 2020, this section has now completed 1 year.So, any regeneration that was coming up is now of the age of 1 year. Now, on first on31st December rather; Now, on 1st of January 2021 you cut up the next section.So, let us say that this section was filled on 1 Jan 2020, this section was filled on1st of Jan 2021, this one was felled on 1st of Jan 2022, 1st of Jan 2023 and so on. So,this is 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. So, this section was felled onfirst of Jan 2035. Now, if we carry on these operations, whatwill be the situation on 1st of Jan 2036? Now on 1st of Jan 2036, this section, thefirst section that we had felled on 1st of Jan 2020, this is now 16 years of age. Thissection that we felled on 1st of Jan 2031 is 15 years of age. This is 14, 13, 12, 11,10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. Now, this is the situation on 1st of January 2036. So,what do you do on 1st of January 2036? You again clear fell this section.So, this date now changes to 1 Jan 2036. Now, let us look at the situation on 1st of Jan2037. Now what is the situation on 1st of Jan 2037? This section that we had felledon 1st of Jan 2036 is 1 year of age. This section that we had felled on 1st of January2021 is now 16 years of age. This is 14; this is 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,4, 3, 2 and this one as 1. Now, on 1st of January 2037, what you do? You clear fellin this section. So, what we are seeing here is that everyyear you can fell one section that is of the age of 16 years, and at the end of the yearor rather the beginning of the next year; on 1st of January of the next year, you willagain have one section of equal area, the area is 10 hectares. So, all of these sectionsare 10 hectares. So, on 1st of January of every year, you willbe having an area of 10 hectares that you can fell on that day, and this can continuetill infinity. So, you can you can perpetually extract this forest of area of 10 hectaresevery year.So, this is the area method. Now, a very clear advantage of this method is that ,it is avery simple method, because you just divide area by the number of years and rotation,and you get the area that needs to be felled every year.It works for any even aged crop, and for most of our landlords in Europe in the seventeenthand eighteenth centuries, they used to prefer the even aged crops. Because those were notthe days of biodiversity; those were the beginning of the days of production forestry and eachcoupe can be intensively treated, because on 1st of January of every year, you are clearfelling the coupe, and then you have the one full year to work only on that coupe.So, the coupes that are felt can be intensively treated and even the other coupes can be veryeasily tended because, all of them are of the same age. However, this method has disadvantages.One; it is difficult to predict the volume, because nowhere we have talked about volume.So, if the landowner were to ask you what is the amount of timber that I will be gettingevery year, we cannot say. What is the amount of revenue that I will be generating everyyear? Well, we cannot say. Then, it is not suited for an uneven aged crop. Because youneed to convert your forest into an even aged forest, then only you will be able to usethis method. And then, it also does not take into account other entry cases such as differencesin the site quality. So, it is possible, for instance, that thisportion of your forest is having more fertility and this portion of the forest is, let ussay, infertile. Now, this method will say that so much of the area has to be felledevery year, but then it belongs to a better site quality and then there will be more amountof timber that the landowner will get in that year. If the area is infertile, we will begetting less amount of timber. So, when we talked about that that we wantedto have an equal yield in every year, then the system will fail. So, it only talks abouta homogeneous forest, in or rather an even aged forest in an in a homogenous situation,in a homogenous piece of land. So, every portion or every parcel of the land is having thesame fertility; it is having the same amount of water availability and so on.So, this is a very simple method, but it as it is own disadvantages the.Now, another method of yield regulation is the volume method. Now, volume method is aslight improvement of the area method. It says that the volume that should be harvestedevery year is equal to the total volume divided by the rotation period.So, what this method is saying is that you figure out what is the total volume of timber,that you have, that is what is the growing stock, that you have divided by the rotationperiod, and you will reach a point where you can say that this is the amount of timberthat I should be extracting every year.Now, here again, this is a very simplified way of putting things. It does not includegrowth and increment of crop, because whenever you are doing these failing operations, theytake time. And, throughout this rotation period, the crop will also be putting up growth; itwill also be putting up increment. But this volume method does not talk about that, andhere again, it does not talk about the site quality.Now, let us look at some more intricate methods. So, this is the Hundeshagen’s method ofyield regulation. Now, this is a much better and a much more scientifically sound method.It is, say it is based on the notion that you can cut more when you have more inventorythan a target normal forest, and you can cut less when you have less inventory than a targetnormal forest.Now, what is it saying, we saw in the case of a selection forest that a selection foresthas N and D, ND curve that looks like this. So, it is an inverse J, ND curve. Now, ifthis is a normal forest, then if you have trees that are, if the actual forest lookslike this, then probably you can cut these sections, and in this section and in thissection, you should not be doing the felling. So, that your forest turns into a normal forest,and it goes on like this for perpetuity. Now, this method says that when you have more inventory.Now, in the case of our selection forest, we are looking at inventory in different diameterclasses or age classes. But then, in the case of Hundeshagen’s method, they only talkabout the total inventory; the total volume of timber that is available in your forest.Now, if you have a target, or rather if you know what a normal forest is, or how an idealforest should look like, if you know what is the total volume of timber that you havein an ideal forest, and then, if you compute the amount of timber that is there in yourforest. And, if there is any discrepancies, then you should do more amount of cutting,more amount of harvesting, if your total inventory is greater than and than the ideal stage.You should do less amount of harvesting, if your total inventory is less than the idealstate. So, essentially what it says is that the amountof harvesting that you should do should be proportional to the inventory that you have.The inventory is another term for growing stock. So, so the total volume of timber thatyou have; if it increases, you should do more harvesting; if it decreases, then you shoulddo less amount of harvesting. So, H is proportional to I, which means thatH t by I t is equal to H of a regular forest divided by I of a regular forest. So, H isthe harvest, I is the inventory. So, this is what it says. H divided by I should bea constant, and how do you get to this constant? Through, say numerical computations, or throughsetting up of a research plot. However, this method also gives absolute results,when it predicts harvest even with no mature trees available felling. So, suppose you havean area where you did a clear-felling, and now, you have planted the young seedlings.And, when you put your area into this equation, you will get that some amount of felling needsto be done even though your plants are only 1 or 2 years of age. So, this method can giveyou certain absurd results.Next, we come to von Mantel’s method of yield regulation. This is one of the mosthighly used methods. It approximates the inventory by the area of triangle. So, what it saysis that, if we look at the stand age for an even aged forest and if we look at volumeper unit area; so, if this age of the stand is more, then these trees have been have gottenmuch more time to put up increment and so, their volume is more. On the other hand, ifthere is a stand that is of 0 years of age; so, the plants have not put up any increment,the total volume is 0.So, essentially what it says is that, if we plotted volume per unit area versus the standage, we will get a curve like this. So, for a higher stand age; let us say 20 years, thevolume per unit area is more, whereas for a lesser age; say 7 years, the volume perunit area in the stand is lesser. Then, it says what is the inventory of a regular forest.Now, this method is now trying to build upon on the Hundeshagen’s method and it sayswhat is the invent.Now, the forest is divided into a number of sections, and every year we will be workingon one particular portion, which is the coupe. Now, the volume of each of these will be givenby v R which is the volume per unit area multiplied by the area of this particular section.Now, in all of these sections, the volume per unit area is different. But, the areaof each section is constant. So, there will be a section which is near to the rotationage. So, we can say that the volume per unit area, in that particular section or in thatparticular coupe, will be written as v small R.Now, the total volume of timber in that particular coupe will be given by, vR into AR, whereAR, is your small a, or the area of that particular coupe. Now then, if you look at this forest,there will be one particular section where the v of that section, v i is equal to 0.Because, it is a very young section; you have just harvested this section and so, thereare no plants or there are plants with a total area of roughly equal to 0, and if we plottedthat the volume.So, there is one coupe which is having a volume of 0, and there is one coupe at the rotationpoint which has a volume of vR. And, the total number of sections that we have is equal tocapital R. Now this now, total number of sections is capital R which is equal to the age ofrotation. And, we can say that the total area of the forest is given by total number ofsections into the area of one section. Now, you can draw a straight line as an approximationand say that different sections are having these different volumes, and total numberof sections are R. So, what is the average volume in one section. So, that will be givenby half into, let us take the 2 extremes 0 plus v R into AR, is the average volume persection. Total number of sections is R. So, the total volume is given by total numberof sections into the average volume per section is equal to R into half of v R into AR. Nowcapital R into AR, is the number of section into the area of each section, is equal tocapital A, which is the area of the forest. So, here we get half of v R into A.So, this is what the von Mantel formula is saying, that the total inventory in a regularforest, because this is an ideal situation; because in practice this will not form a triangle,it is possible that here the volumes will be less. And here, the volumes will be morethan that of more than that what the von Mantel’s approximation is predicting.Because, earlier the growth rate is very slow. As we saw earlier, in the case of a sigmaideal curve or a logistic growth equation that in the early phases, the growth is veryslow and in the later phases, the growth increases till a maximum; till it reaches a maximumvalue, and then it again goes down to 0. So, this is how the actual curve will look.The blue one is the actual curve and the red one is a von Mantel approximation. Now here,this total volume is the ideal volume or the volume of a regular forest. Now, H in a regularforest or the amount of harvesting that you will be doing in the regular forest will begiven by the by the coupe that has reached it is maturity.Now, in when it is reached it is maturity, though we are talking about this final coupe.So, in this year, what is the amount that you will be harvesting? The amount that youwill be harvesting in the regular forest is given by vR, which is the volume per unitarea in the in the rotation, H multiplied by AR, which is the area of this particularcoupe. So, it says that H in a regular forest or ideal forest is AR into v R.Now, for a regulated forest AR is equal to capital A divided by R, because we have dividedthe forest into equal area sections. So, now, we can say that H regular is equal to AR whichis A by R into v R.Now, putting this into the Hundeshagen’s formula, we get H t by I t that is harvestingat time t divided by the inventory at time t is given by H of an ideal forest dividedby I of the ideal forest. Now, H of the ideal forest is what we sawhere A by R into v R. So, we put it here A by R into v R.I of a regulated forest is given by half of A into v R.So, we put that here half of A into vR. Now A and A get cancelled, vR and vR get cancelled.So, this comes to be 2 by R. So, H by I is equal to 2 by R or H is given by 2 into Iby R. So, this is the formula given by von Mental,which tells us the amount of harvesting that we can do in a sustained manner. So, thatwill be given by 2 times of the growing stock divided by the rotation period. So, this isdifferent from what we had seen in the volume method. Now, in the volume approximation,we said the amount that can be harvested every year is the growing stock divided by R, buthere we are saying that it is actually 2 times the growing stock divided by R. Now, why arewe getting this 2 time? Because, this forest is not a static forest, and each section isputting up increments.Another method of yield regulation; is the Austrian formula. Now, the Austrian formulasays that, if you consider any forest and your forest is not an ideal forest, one; yourforest is putting up a natural increment every year, and whatever increment it is puttingis something that you can be easily extract. So, essentially, coming back to our exampleof the bank, the increment that you are getting every year which is 10000  is something that you can very easily extract from the bank; so, this is given. However, you can also look at a projected value of how much amount do you actually need in your bank.So, suppose, you decide that I want to have say 50 say only 50000  in my bank, andI want to bring these 100000  to 50000  over a period of say 20 years. So,then in each of these 20 years, you can take out some extra money, because at the end of20 years you only require 50000 , or else you can even say that no I am these 100000 is not sufficient for me. At the end of 20 years, I want to have 100 and 50000. So, the Austrian formula looks at a very similarsituation. It says that you can always take out the increment, but this increment will be modulated by what is your current scenario, and what is the ideal scenario that you want.So, it says that the amount of harvesting is equal to increment plus I t minus I reg,divided by P. So, I t is the inventory that you have at time t, I reg is the inventorythat you want in a regular forest or that is the ideal forest, divided by a time periodP, over which you want to bring your forest to a state of the regulated forest.So, suppose in this example, if you wanted to put these values, we have I t is equalto 100000 , I reg suppose I want to have more amount of money in my forest inmy bank account. Suppose, I want to have 125000  and I want to change this 100000 to125000 over a period of say 20 years. So, the Austrian formula would say that theamount that I can extract out every year is equal to the increment which is 10000 plusI t which is 100000 minus 125000 divided by 20. So, this is 10000 minus 25000 dividedby 20 is 8750 . So, what this formula is predicting is that I should take out not10000 , but 8750  so that, every year I am adding to the increment.So, the increment is large, but I am taking out a small portion. So, that at the end of20 years, my bank account gets to a level of 125000 . So, similarly, if you lookat a forest, you can take out the increment, but it will be modulated by what you wantto have at the end of P years.Next is the Cotta formula. Now, the Cotta formula says that in a periodic block, a treecut in the beginning puts up no increment, because this tree is gone. So, if there isno tree, there will not be any increment. So, a tree that is cut at the beginning isputting up no increment, whereas a tree that is cut that is getting cut at the end of theperiod is getting the whole period of P years, to put up the increment. So, it puts up thecomplete increment that is possible for it. So, on average in a periodic block, the treeswill put up half the increment they could, if they were left untouched. So, here again,we are looking at the average values there are some trees that are putting up incrementfor all the P years. There are some trees that are putting up increment only for 0 yearsor rather no increment. So, on an average we can say that the trees will be able toput up half the increment over P years or full increment over P by 2 year.So, in this case the total volume that is available during the period is equal to thevolume that you have in the stand plus the possible increment divided by 2. You are takingthis half because some trees will be cut during the beginning of the periodic drop periodand some trees will be cut at the end of it. Now, the annual yield will be given by thisvolume divided by period P; so, this comes to be V by P plus i by 2. Where small ‘I’is given as the annual increment which is this total increment divided by P. So, thistotal increment was coming up in P years. So, you have V by P plus i by 2 as the annualyield.Another method is yield regulation by the number of trees. So, here again as we sawearlier, if we plot the ND curve and if the actual forest is coming at a deviation tothe ND curve, then the yield regulation by the number of trees - we will say that, forthis DBH, you can cut these many number of trees. For this DBH, you can cut these manynumber of trees.So, essentially what we are trying to do here is that, this is ND curve; it looks like this,but the actual forest is showing something like this. So, these trees can be cut veryeasily and these trees should be, they should be ample amount of protection given. And,no cutting done, so that, after a while, when this the section moves towards the right,it will come back to the normal forest. So, this method is known as yield regulation bythe number of trees.Next, we also have yield regulation by simulation that we make use of in these days. Now, yieldregulation by simulation makes use of computer programs to do the number crunching. So, theseare the steps; one, you input the current inventory in terms of trees, species, location,diameter, height and site quality. So, essentially you are modeling your forest.So, if this is your forest, you are telling the computer that at this point there is atree of this particular species; of this DBH; of this height; at this site quality, andso on. Similarly, you are giving the information for this tree, you are giving an informationfor this tree, you are giving an information for this tree and so on.Now, because we know how different trees grow at different site qualities over differentage classes. So, now, you can ask your computer to simulate how this forest will grow, andhow this forest will appear say at the end of 5 years. Now, if you can do these computations,you can also do another computation, which is that of a simulation. You can ask the computerthat suppose out of all these trees I remove a few trees. So, at the end of 5 years, supposeI get to the conclusion that this tree is matured, this tree is mature, this tree ismature; and I remove these trees at the end of 5 years, then after 5 more years that isat the end of 10 years, how would this forest look like? What would be the situation? Andat that point of time which is the other tree that I can remove.So, you can do these iterations again and again to figure out which tree needs to beremoved, and also what will be the volume that you will be getting out of this removal.So, essentially, this steps allow you simulate your forests in the computer, input the knowngrowth parameters. So, you are telling the computer that for this particular site quality,for this species, for this DBH, and height class tree, what is the growth that normallysuch a tree shows? So, you are putting the growth parameters.Then, you iterate it to generate the growth pattern of the forest how will the forestlook after 1 year, after 2 years, after 3 years and so on. Then, you make a decisionabout felling. So, you can look at any snapshot of the forest, and you can say that, “thesetrees are now mature and I am going to remove them in these years.” And, once these treesget removed next so, you put, you input this felling decision in the model, and then youdo an iteration again. So, then you again tell you again ask the computer that thesetrees are now removed how will this forest again look like after 1 year, after 2 years,after 3 years and so on. And, by doing this, you can estimate which trees need to be felled,and what is the volume that you will be getting out of these fellings.So, in this lecture, we looked at what is yield. So, yield can be defined in two ways;one you remove all the trees from your snapshot forest. And, two you remove trees in sucha manner that every year; you are getting the same amount of timber which is known asa sustained yield. Now, doing these computations are a bit intricateearlier. We went with the area method in which we said that for an equal that for an evenaged forest; you just take total area divided by the number of years of rotation and thatis the area that you are going to clear fell every year.Now, that had its own disadvantages, because of which we met we went to the volume method,where we said that total volume divided by the number of years of rotation will giveyou the volume that you should be extracting every year. And then, we built on these concepts.And finally, these days we are making use of computer simulations to make an exact prediction of when what should be removed, and how much of the yield will be able to get.
